# pdf_section_extract
Script to extract individual sections from a pdf file and save them as txt files

- Based on the "Inhaltsverzeichnis" (content menu) it identifies section headers and extracts those saving them into txt-files named after sections.
- Does not work if no Content menu exists.
- Does not work if section headers are not identically to those in the content menu.
- Quality of output depends on quality of pdf file.
- (Currently page on which content body starts still needs to manually be put in.)
