# pdf_section_extract
Script to extract individual sections from a pdf file and save them as txt files

- Based on the "Inhaltsverzeichnis" (table of content) it identifies section headers and extracts those saving them into txt-files named after sections.
- Does not work if no table of content exists.
- Does not work if section headers are not identically to those in the table of content.
- Quality of output depends on quality of pdf file.
- (Currently page on which content body starts still needs to manually be put in, when table of content is longer than one page.)
